# Lyra

Lyra is a fully asynchronous Python library designed for communicating with [Lavalink v4](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink) or [NodeLink v3](https://github.com/PerformanC/NodeLink) seamlessly within [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) or [py-cord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord). It provides 100% API coverage of the Lavalink v4 spec through easy-to-use functions. Platform support (Spotify, Apple Music, Bilibili, etc.) is handled server-side via Lavalink plugins such as [LavaSrc](https://github.com/topi314/LavaSrc).

Lyra is a fork of the original [Pomice](https://github.com/cloudwithax/pomice) library, fully refactored for Lavalink v4 and NodeLink v3.
